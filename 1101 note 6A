// Run time: each step is the one call of function

// bin


// binary search 

/* BST has properties of left subtree smaller than the entry

and right subtree bigger than the entry */

// BST cut down the problem by half for each call to find the answer quicker


// total order means data in one set can be compared by using > < or =.



/* sort the list by comparing the head and head of the tail; if the later bigger






/* Selection sort by using remove function.

selection_sort is a model function and we need use another function to solve it*/


// initial value in accumulate function has no impact to the accumulation


m = n / 2 for merge sort: before merge, the list need to be sorted first. the sorted list 

Binary search need the list or lists to be sorted in order.



symbolic ealuation is a set up for symbolic differentiation.
