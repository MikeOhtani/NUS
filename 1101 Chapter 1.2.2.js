// Function with recursive call will give u either recurssive or iterative processes


// function g(x) {
//     return (x === 0) ? 0 : 1 + g(x - 1);
// }
// recursive process will give the distribute of accumulation of deffered equations, in the function 1+ g(x-1) will produce deferred equations.

// (ii) function f(x, y) {
//     return (x === 0) ? y : f(x - 1, y + 1);
// (a) iterative process will evaluation each step first before going to the next step of evaluation, f(x-1, x+1) will be evaluate first at each function call before going to the other.
   (b) 

// (iii) in computer operation, the time of program operation can be measured the steps of operation which are undertaken by the computer.
